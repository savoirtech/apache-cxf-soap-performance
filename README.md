# Apache CXF SOAP Performance

You know what would be fun? Running 1 Billion soap invocations through
CXF!

# The Setup

For our lab test weâ€™ll be using the following hardware:

- Dell PowerEdge R250 (Client Host)

  - Intel Xeon E-2378 (8c, 16t)

  - 128 GB DDR4 RAM

The machines are co-located on the same switch, reducing the number of
packet hops.
