== Apache CXF SOAP Performance

You know what would be fun? Running 1 Billion soap invocations through CXF!

== The Setup

For our lab test we'll be using the following hardware:

 * Dell PowerEdge R250 (Client Host)
 ** Intel Xeon E-2378 (8c, 16t)
 ** 128 GB DDR4 RAM
 ** 1 Gigabit Ethernet
 * Raptor Blackbird (Server Host)
 ** POWER9 (8c, 32 t)
 ** 128 GB DDR4 RAM
 ** 1 Gigabit Ethernet

The machines are co-located on the same switch, reducing the number of packet hops.
