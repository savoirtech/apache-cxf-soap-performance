== Apache CXF SOAP Performance

You know what would be fun? Running 1 Billion soap invocations through CXF!

== The Setup

image::./assets/images/HardwareSetup.png[alt=Hardware,width=480,height=640,align="center"]

For our lab test we'll be using the following hardware:

 * Dell PowerEdge R250 (Client Host)
 ** Intel Xeon E-2378 (8c, 16t)
 ** 128 GB DDR4 RAM
 ** 1 Gigabit Ethernet
 * Raptor Blackbird (Server Host)
 ** POWER9 (8c, 32 t)
 ** 128 GB DDR4 RAM
 ** 1 Gigabit Ethernet

The machines are co-located on the same switch, reducing the number of packet hops.

== The Performance Harness

As of CXF 4.1 the binary distribution will contain a set of performance scripts in the samples folder. Options to test JAX-WS and JAX-RS are present.

At its core, the performance harness is a client-server request/response automation. On startup the script initializes and warms up the JVM for executing mass calls.

=== How it works

The client host runs a number of threads, each running a CXF client which invokes up the server host. For JAX-WS testing, we have a choice of invoking on DocPortType as String, Base64, or as a ComplexType. The client side harness will run N threads for M invocations for a duration of time.

Once the time duration has been met, it will cease the executing clients, and tabulate the total invocations.

== Lets get this test case running

To run the performance harness we change directory into samples.
Within this folder we'll build the base harness and the various scenarios.

On each host we will open a terminal to the CXF distribution samples folder.

[,bash,linenum]
----
$ cd samples
$ mvn clean install
$ cd performance/soap_http_doc_lit
----

On the Server host we'll execute the following maven profile:

[,bash,linenum]
----
$mvn -Pserver -Dhost=0.0.0.0 -Dprotocol=http
----

On the Client host we'll execute the client profile, supplying instructions to use HTTP protocol, echoComplexTypeDoc operation, use 100 threads (simulate 100 clients), over a time of 8 hours (60 x 60 x 8 = 28800 seconds).

[,bash,linenum]
----
$mvn -Pclient -Dhost=192.168.50.154 -Dprotocol=http -Doperation=echoComplexTypeDoc -Dthreads=100 -Dtime=28800
----

For the purposes of our lab test, we'll allow the suite to execute without added agents to the JVM.
