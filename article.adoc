== Apache CXF SOAP Performance

You know what would be fun? Running 1 Billion soap invocations through CXF!

== The Setup

For our lab test we'll be using the following hardware:

 * Dell PowerEdge R250 (Client Host)
 ** Intel Xeon E-2378 (8c, 16t)
 ** 128 GB DDR4 RAM
 ** 1 Gigabit Ethernet
 * Raptor Blackbird (Server Host)
 ** POWER9 (8c, 32 t)
 ** 128 GB DDR4 RAM
 ** 1 Gigabit Ethernet

The machines are co-located on the same switch, reducing the number of packet hops.

== The Performance Harness

As of CXF 4.1 the binary distribution will contain a set of performance scripts in the samples folder. Options to test JAX-WS and JAX-RS are present.

At its core, the performance harness is a client-server request/response automation. On startup the script initializes and warms up the JVM for executing mass calls.

=== How it works

The client host runs a number of threads, each running a CXF client which invokes up the server host. For JAX-WS testing, we have a choice of invoking on DocPortType as String, Base64, or as a ComplexType. The client side harness will run N threads for M invocations for a duration of time.

Once the time duration has been met, it will cease the executing clients, and tabulate the total invocations.

== Lets get this test case running

To run the performance harness we change directory into samples/performance.
Within this folder we'll build the base harness and the various scenarios.

For the purposes of our lab test, we'll configure the test to use 100 clients, over a period of 8 hours (60 * 60 * 8 = 28800 seconds).
